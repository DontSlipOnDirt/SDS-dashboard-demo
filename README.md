## Setting up the environment
Clone this github repo into the SDS cluster after opening up VSCode by opening the terminal with `Ctrl` + `~` and pasting in this: `git clone https://github.com/DontSlipOnDirt/SDS-dashboard-demo.git`. This will copy and create a folder with all the files of this repo in your own portion of the SDS cluster. Navigate by terminal into the folder and if you are using `[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)` as package manager for Python, use `uv sync` to sync dependencies. Then run the dashboard with `uv run streamlit run Intro.py`.
